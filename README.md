## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- Make sure your `config.json` is valid and contains the correct API keys.
- Only providers with a valid API key will be used.
- If you get timeouts, try increasing the `timeout` value in your config.
- For best results, use clear Dutch audio in WAV or MP3 format.

## Installation

### Using pip

```bash
pip install requests openai
```

### Using venv

Create a new virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install requests openai
```

### Dependencies

- `requests` for API calls
- `openai` for OpenAI Whisper and ChatGPT integration


## Configuration

Create a `config.json` file in your project directory with your API keys and prompts:

### Example config.json

```json
{
  "assemblyai_api_key": "YOUR_ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY",           // AssemblyAI API key
  "speechmatics_api_key": "YOUR_SPEECHMATICS_API_KEY",       // Speechmatics API key
  "openai_api_key": "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY",                   // OpenAI API key (Whisper)
  "groq_api_key": "YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY",                       // Groq API key
  "groq_whisper_endpoint": "https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/audio/transcriptions", // Groq Whisper endpoint

  "aws_access_key_id": "YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID",             // AWS Access Key
  "aws_secret_access_key": "YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY",     // AWS Secret Key
  "aws_region": "YOUR_AWS_REGION",                           // AWS Region (e.g. eu-west-1)

  "deepgram_api_key": "YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY",               // Deepgram API key

  "ibm_api_key": "YOUR_IBM_API_KEY",                         // IBM Watson API key
  "ibm_url": "YOUR_IBM_URL",                                 // IBM Watson service URL

  "revai_api_key": "YOUR_REVAI_API_KEY",                     // Rev AI API key

  "vatis_api_key": "YOUR_VATIS_API_KEY",                     // Vatis Tech API key

  "prompt": "Transcribe the following Dutch audio as accurately as possible.",
  "combine_prompt": "You will receive multiple transcripts of the same audio file. Combine these into a single transcript that is as accurate and complete as possible, without summarizing. Preserve original sentences, order, and details. Only correct errors if absolutely necessary for clarity. Do not add anything that was not in the original transcripts.",
  "timeout": 10                                               // Optional: timeout in seconds for provider requests

- The `prompt` field is optional and will be used by providers that support it (OpenAI Whisper, Groq Whisper).
- The `combine_prompt` field is used as the system prompt when sending all STT results to OpenAI ChatGPT for the final, combined transcript. If not set, a default Dutch DND prompt is used.
- AssemblyAI currently does not support prompts for the default Universal model (the script handles this automatically).
- All API keys are required for their respective providers.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install requests openai
   ```
2. Run the script with an audio file:
   ```bash
   python transcriber.py path/to/your_audio.wav
   ```
3. Each run creates a new timestamped folder in `recordings/` (e.g., `recordings/run_20250601_224825/`).
4. Each provider's output is saved as a separate text file in that folder (e.g., `AssemblyAI.txt`, `Speechmatics.txt`, etc.).
5. Results are printed to the console as soon as they are ready.
